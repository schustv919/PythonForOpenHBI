# PythonForOpenHPI Rookie level

## Python for Beginners which are OPENHPI participants 

In this repo we can share and discuss some starting codes like:

from tkinter import * # import tkinter as tk
win=Tk()
b=Button(win, text = "Button")
b.pack()
spin=Spinbox(win, from_=1, to=5)
spin.pack()
checkbutton=Checkbutton(win, text="Python")
checkbutton.pack()
win.mainloop()

If you see any Python codes we can try out and find maybe any improvements
